Tweak CSS Tests
===============

A bookmarklet that helps you running the [CSS Test Suites]
on your browser.

## Overview

CSS syntax may change during the development of the specifications.
The [CSS Test Suites] uses the most recent syntax,
but the browser you want to test may support only old syntaxes.

This bookmarklet dynamically modifies the DOM for your browser,
so that you can test layout and/or behavior
before the browser adopts to the new syntax.

Supports [CSS Writing Modes Level 3] for Chrome/Safari.
